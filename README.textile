h1. BioReports

Jekyll template for shared report generation.

h2. What is BioReports?

This is a Jekyll site framework meant to be used in conjunction with a "Custom version of Jekyll":https://github.com/vlandham/jekyll and "Hastie":https://github.com/vlandham/hastie - a command line tool for quick report creation.

h2. How to use?

Clone this repository to a location accessible by all people who need to make reports.

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:vlandham/hastie.git /shared/drive/location/bioreports_source
</pre>

Create a @server@ branch of the BioReports repository

<pre>
git branch server
git checkout server
</pre>

Modify the @.gitignore@ in the server branch to remove exclusions of @_posts/@ and @data@.

Modify @_config.yml@ and @_server_config.yml@ as you see fit.

Add more plugins or javascript or css.

Ensure you have the forked version of Jekyll accessible to all report creators.

<pre>
which jekyll
# /shared/gems/custom/jekyll
</pre>

Ensure you have Hastie accessible to all report creators.

Create @.hastie@ files for all users to point to @bioreports_source@ location.

<pre>
hastie config /shared/drive/location/bioreports_source
</pre>

Now when you use @hastie publish@ it should publish to your @bioreports_source@ directory which will in turn update your @bioreports@ page.

Enjoy!
